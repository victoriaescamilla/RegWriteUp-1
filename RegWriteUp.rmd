```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
```

## First Read in the data

```{r}
theData <- read.csv(file="datadata.csv",header = TRUE)
```

Now we are going to look at what relations exists between our variables with plots.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots for example:

### ggplot SIMS~ARM
```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(theData,aes(x=SIMS,y=ARM))
```
## SIMS and ARM plot
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_lm()
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_lm() + geom_smooth()
```
## Now lets take a look at how the SIMS and GRIP correlate.
